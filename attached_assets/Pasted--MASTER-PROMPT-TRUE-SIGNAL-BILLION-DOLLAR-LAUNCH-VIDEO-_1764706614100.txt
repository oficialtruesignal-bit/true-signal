# MASTER PROMPT: TRUE SIGNAL "BILLION DOLLAR" LAUNCH VIDEO

**STYLE GUIDE & AESTHETICS:**
Genre: High-stakes financial thriller meets elite sports. "Moneyball" on steroids.
Visual Tone: Luxurious, dark, moody, cinematic, high-contrast.
Color Palette: Deep blacks, charcoal greys, accented by electric neon green (#33b864).
Lighting: Anamorphic lens flares, dramatic side-lighting (chiaroscuro), neon reflections on glass surfaces.
VFX style: Subtle HUD (Heads Up Display) overlays, data streams, glitch transitions, speed ramps.
Camera Movement: Dynamic gimbal shots, slow intricate push-ins, fast whip-pans between scenes. It must feel expensive and fast-paced.

**NARRATIVE FLOW & SCENES (GENERATE THESE SEQUENCES):**

**SCENE 1: THE HOOK (Speed & Data)**
*Action:* A montage of intense professional soccer action. A striker kicking a ball in super slow motion (120fps), rain falling, stadium lights flaring.
*VFX:* As the ball travels, glowing green data points and trajectory lines materialize around it. The raw chaotic energy of the sport is being quantized by an invisible system.

**SCENE 2: THE WAR ROOM (Human Intelligence + Tech)**
*Setting:* A dimly lit, ultra-modern operations center ("The Bunker"). Glass walls, dark wood, brushed metal.
*Action:* A dynamic gimbal shot moving through a team of 10-15 sharp-dressed analysts (mixed genders, focused expressions). The room is filled with massive wall-sized LED screens showing multiple live soccer matches simultaneously.
*Key Detail:* On the desk monitors, we clearly see the dark/green "TRUE SIGNAL" desktop interface showing graphs and probability lists. An analyst points at a screen, another nods seriously. The atmosphere is intense focus.

**SCENE 3: THE PRODUCT (App Showcase & UI Flow)**
*Action:* A luxurious close-up shot of a hand holding the latest iPhone Pro Max (titanium black). The screen is the hero.
*UI Interaction:* The thumb performs a smooth, fast scroll through the "True Signal" app dashboard. We see the "Central de Operações" with the growth graph rising. The scroll stops on a list of signals.
*Key Detail:* The screen shows a high-probability ticket ("Chelsea vs Barcelona - Vitória Visitante @2.50") with a glowing green "91.9% Assertividade" badge. The user taps "COPIAR BILHETE". The UI must look native, fluid, and premium.

**SCENE 4: THE AI ENGINE (Predictive Analysis Visualized)**
*Action:* Abstract macro cinematography. We dive inside a microchip or a server rack.
*VFX:* Billions of data particles (small green lights) converge into a complex neural network structure. The chaos organizes itself into a clear, glowing green arrow pointing upwards. Text overlays flash rapidly: "PROCESSING 1.400 LEAGUES", "PREDICTIVE MODELING: ENGAGED", "HIGH PROBABILITY DETECTED".

**SCENE 5: THE RESULT & BRANDING (The Climax)**
*Action:* Back to the soccer field. The ball hits the back of the net. The crowd goes wild (slow motion).
*Overlay:* Simultaneously, on the phone screen from Scene 3, a massive green notification pops up: "✅ GREEN CONFIRMADO! +R$ 1.250,00".
*Final Shot:* The TRUE SIGNAL logo (shield icon) forms on a dark background with cinematic fog and green backlighting. Text appears below: "Inteligência Esportiva. Nível Bilhão."

**OVERALL MOOD:**
The final video must feel like an adrenaline rush of success, technology, and absolute control over the market. It must look undeniably real and expensive.
